Participants requiring supporting letters for a visa to enter the United States of America should contact the LOC.

## Accomodation
### On-campus housing
On campus housing is available at the Lincoln Hall at East-West Center (EWC). Campus housing is within a few minutes walk from the conference venue. Please be aware that this is inexpensive (for Hawaiʻi), no-frills accommodation and that the rooms are not air conditioned. Temperatures in Honolulu in July can reach ~87F/30C, but the island often has strong breezes (many personal residences in the valley have no A/C or heating at all!).

On-campus housing must be booked no later than May 12, 2023. Attendees looking to stay on campus housing must pay a 2 night room security deposit by this deadline to hold a room (see registration for details].
